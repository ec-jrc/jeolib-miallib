Organization of pyMIA
---------------------

Modules
^^^^^^^

The pyMIA package is grouped in modules. A module combines a number of operations that belong together. The models defined pyMIA are:

 * io: input/output operations
 * geometry: operations that relate to geometry
 * geodesy: operations that relate to morphological geodesic transformations
 * pointop: pixel operations
 * dem: operations on digital elevation models


Most of the morphological functions available in pyMIA are detailed in :cite:`soille2004sv`.

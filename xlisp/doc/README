Make sure that the buid directory is included in the TEXINPUTS variable at shell level and also in the file .late2html-init!

The latex2html produced documentation is stored in build/html/

In case build directory is changed in Makefile, please adapt manually any occurence of ../build/ in the other files (use of grep '../build/' *).
